# FriendFinder

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take 
in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. 
The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

#Hosting on Heroku

Now that we have a backend to our applications, we use Heroku for hosting. 
Please note that while Heroku is free, 
it will request credit card information if you have more than 5 applications at a time or are adding a database. 

Please see Herokuâ€™s Account Verification Information for more details.
